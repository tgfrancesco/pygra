Toolbar
~~~~~~~

- **🔍 Zoom** — click and drag to zoom into a region
- **✋ Pan** — click and drag to pan the view
- **⌂ Reset** — restore the original view
- **↺ Legend** — reset the legend to its automatic position
- **Coordinate display** — x and y values under the cursor, shown in real
  time on the right side of the toolbar when hovering over the plot

Color picker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The color picker uses the Qt dialog (same appearance on all platforms).
The **Basic colors** grid can be replaced with any scientific palette via
**View → Color palette**. A checkmark indicates the active palette, and
the name of the active palette is shown in the color picker itself
("Basic colors palette (active: ...)"). The chosen palette is saved in
preferences and restored at next launch.

On **Linux**, the **Pick Screen Color** button captures any color visible on
screen. On **macOS** and **Windows** this button is hidden, as platform
security restrictions prevent capturing colors outside the dialog window.

Custom colors added via **Add to Custom Colors** are saved in preferences
and restored at next launch on all platforms.

Draggable legend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After plotting, click and drag the legend to reposition it anywhere on the
figure. The position is preserved across subsequent plots. Click **↺ Legend**
in the toolbar to reset to automatic positioning.

Legend style options are available in **View → Style settings**: frame on/off,
background transparency, number of columns, symbol size, and default position.

User preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyGRA saves preferences automatically to ``~/.config/pygra/preferences.json``
when you close the application. These include:

- Window geometry and panel proportions
- Style settings (fonts, grid, theme, DPI, figure size)
- Last used color palette
- Custom colors

Use **View → Save preferences** to save at any time, or
**View → Reset preferences** to restore defaults.

File format
-----------

Files should be whitespace-delimited with one data point per row.
Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments and ignored.
