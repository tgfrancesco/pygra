# Changelog

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- macOS DMG now includes Applications folder shortcut (drag-to-install)
- Documented macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen security warnings

### Changed
- Documentation: Download moved to a dedicated page separate from Installation
- Documentation: added security notes for macOS and Windows first launch

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Coordinate display: mouse coordinates (x, y) shown in real time in the toolbar when hovering over the plot
- Checkmark in View → Color palette menu to indicate the active palette
- Active palette name shown in the color picker pre-dialog ("Basic colors palette (active: ...)")
- GitHub Actions workflow: automatic builds for macOS (.dmg), Linux (.tar.gz), and Windows (.exe) on every release

### Fixed
- CLI parser: per-file `--x`/`--y` no longer bleed into subsequent files without explicit column settings
- Version aligned to `0.6.0` across `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `state.py`
- Package data path corrected to include `logo/` directory

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- 83 pytest tests covering `DataSet` loading, all `apply_transform` operations,
  all fit functions, and CLI parser behavior
  (`tests/test_dataset.py`, `tests/test_fitting.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`)

### Fixed
- Dataset loading now shows a warning dialog listing skipped row count, line
  numbers, and content instead of silently discarding malformed rows
- `fit_custom`: math functions (e.g. `exp`, `sin`) no longer overwrite numpy
  ufuncs in the formula namespace; array formulas now work correctly
- Replaced bare `except:` and `except Exception: pass` blocks across `main.py`,
  `dialogs.py`, `mainwindow.py`, `palettes.py`, and `preferences.py` with
  specific exception types and stderr warnings so failures are visible

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Draggable legend: click and drag the legend anywhere on the plot; position persists across replots
- Legend style options in Style settings: frame on/off, background transparency, number of columns, symbol size, default position
- ↺ Legend button in toolbar to reset legend to automatic position
- Color palette browser: View → Color palette replaces the Basic colors grid in the color picker with scientific palettes (colorblind-friendly, matplotlib categorical, sequential/diverging, CSS color families)
- Custom colors saved to preferences and restored at next launch on all platforms
- Pick Screen Color hidden on macOS and Windows (platform limitation); works correctly on Linux
- Closeable series tabs: click ✕ to remove a series
- DataEditorDialog: Analysis → Edit data (Ctrl+D) — editable table, add/delete rows, non-destructive
- FitLayer double-click: edit label, line style, line width, and color of fit curves
- Persistent user preferences saved to `~/.config/pygra/preferences.json`: window geometry, splitter position, style settings, color palette
- View → Save preferences / Reset preferences
- Window geometry and panel proportions restored automatically on launch
- Save figure (Ctrl+E) added to File menu
- Configurable figure size (width × height in inches) for saving, independent of window size
- Resizable left panel (drag the splitter)
- Linux dock/launcher icon via `install_icon_linux.sh`
- Scientific palettes module (`palettes.py`): Okabe-Ito, Wong, Tol, tab10/20, Set1/2/3, Paired, Dark2, Pastel1, viridis, plasma, coolwarm, RdYlBu, CSS color families

### Fixed
- Colors from Appearance dialog now correctly applied to the plot
- Histogram mode no longer crashes with `KeyError: 'label'`
- CLI: positional file arguments supported (`pygra *.dat` works as expected)

### Changed
- Left panel width is now flexible (min 280px, max 500px) instead of fixed
- Label moved from series panel into Appearance dialog
- Qt color dialog used on all platforms (`DontUseNativeDialog`) for consistent appearance and custom color support
